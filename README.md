# Super

## Learning Goals

- Reduce repeated code and enhance objects using inheritance.
  - Use `super` to call methods on a parent class from the child class.
- Accomplish complex programming tasks using knowledge from previous modules..

***

## Key Vocab

- **Inheritance**: a tool that allows us to recycle code by creating a class
that "inherits" the attributes and methods of a parent class.
- **Composition**: a tool that enables you to recycle code by adding objects to
other objects. Rather than building on a base class as in inheritance,
composition leverages the attributes and methods of an instance of another class.
- **Subclass**: a class that inherits from another class. Colloquially called
a "child" class.
- **Superclass**: a class that is inherited by another class. Colloquially
called a "parent" class.
- **Child**: another name for a subclass.
- **Parent**: another name for a superclass.
- **`super()`**: a built-in Python function that allows us to manipulate the
attributes and methods of a superclass from the body of its subclass.
- **Decorator**: syntax that allows us to add functionality to an object
without modifying its structure.

## Introduction

So far, we've seen the benefits of using inheritance to create a group of
classes that share certain characteristics and behaviors. However, up until now,
the implementation of shared characteristics has been somewhat rigid. If class
`Student` inherits from class `User`, we can choose to either allow the
`Student` class to inherit a certain method from `User` or overwrite that method
with another implementation that is specific to `Student`.

But what if there is a method in the parent class that we want our child to
share _some_ of the functionality of? Or what if we want our child class to
inherit a method from the parent and then augment it in some way? We can achieve
this with the use of the `super` keyword.

## Using `super` to Supercharge Inheritance

Let's say we are working on an education app in which users are either students
or teachers. We have a parent, `User` class, that both our `Student` and
`Teacher` classes inherit from.

Our `User` class has a method, `log_in()`, that sets an instance variable,
`self.logged_in` equal to `True`.

```py
class User:
    def log_in(self):
        self.logged_in = True
```

However, when a student logs into our app, we need to not only set their logged
in attribute to `True`, we need to set their "in class" attribute to `True` as
well. We could simply edit the `log_in()` method in the `User` class to account
for this. But that doesn't make sense here. Remember that both `Student` and
`Teacher` inherit from `User`. Teachers don't need to indicate that they are
"in class", so we don't want to alter the `log_in()` method of our parent class
and inadvertently give teachers some behavior that they don't want or need.

Instead, we can augment, or supercharge, the `log_in()` method _inside_ of the
`Student` class.

Let's take a look:

```py
class Student(User):
    def log_in(self):
        super().log_in()
        self.in_class = True
```

Here, we re-define the `log_in()` method and tell it to inherit any
functionality of the `log_in()` method defined in the parent, or "superclass,"
which is `User`.

In the `log_in()` method above, the `super` keyword will **call on the
`log_in()` method as defined in the superclass**. _Then_, the additional code
that we're adding into our `Student.log_in()` method will also run. We have
therefore supercharged our `log_in()` method, for the `Student` class only.

You can see for yourself by adding a `print()` statement in the `log_in()`
methods for both the `User` and `Student` classes. Run this code in the Python
shell or in a new Python file:

```py
class User:
    def log_in(self):
        print("User.log_in() called.")
        self.logged_in = True

class Student(User):
    def log_in(self):
        print("Student.log_in() called.")
        super().log_in()
        self.in_class = True

oneil = Student()
oneil.log_in()
# "Student.log_in() called."
# "User.log_in() called."
# True
```

As you can see by the output of running `log_in()` on a `Student` instance, the
`super` keyword calls the specified method in the parent class, adding the
functionality of the original method to your new method in a single line.

## Calling `super` With Arguments

The `log_in()` method defined above didn't take any arguments, but often, we'll
need to call methods and provide some data as arguments. For example, let's
modify our `User` class to give it a `name` attribute:

```py
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def log_in(self):
        self.logged_in = True
```

Let's also modify our `Student` class so that it can be initialized with a
`name` and a `grade` attribute:

```py
class Student(User):
    def __init__(self, name, grade)
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade


    def log_in(self):
        super().log_in()
        self.in_class = True
```

While we can still create new students with our updated class definition, it's
not particularly DRY — both the `Student` and `User` classes define a `name`
instance variable and set it when the class is instantiated.

Ideally, we'd like to be able to call the `__init__` method on the `User`
class when a new student is created.

`super` lets us do just that! We can call `super` with an argument from the
`Student.__init__` method, which will call the `User.__init__` method with
that argument. Try updating the example code like so:

```py
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        print("User.__init__ called.")
        self.name = name

    def log_in(self):
        self.logged_in = True

class Student(User):
    def __init__(self, name, grade):
        print("Student.__init__ called.")
        super().__init__(name)
        self.grade = grade

    def log_in(self):
        super().log_in()
        self.in_class = True

oneil = Student("O'neil", 10)
# Student.__init__ called.
# User.__init__ called.
oneil.__dict__
# {'name': "O'neil", 'grade': 10}
```

Just like in the previous example, `super` is used to call a method on the
superclass from the subclass — the only difference is that this time we are
passing in arguments that are required by the method defined in the superclass.

<details><summary><em><code>__init__</code> is the method that uses
<code>super()</code> the most. Why do you think that is?</em></summary>
<p>

<h3>Every class has an <code>__init__</code> method.</h3>

## Conclusion

Often when you are dealing with code that involves inheritance, you'll need
to augment the functionality defined in the superclass with some additional
behavior in the subclass. The `super` keyword allows you to do just that!
